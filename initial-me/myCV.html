<h3 class="headings"><a id="profile">Profile</a></h3>
<p><strong>Dedicated and highly motivated second year Aberystwyth University student majoring in Computer Science and on track for a first class grade. I have a natural passion for software and possess good problem solving and solution building skills. Had experience with various programming languages including Java, C++ and Perl.</strong></p>

<li>I have since then used MATLAB and Java skills to design software that helps in quickly detecting possible tumour location in regards to prostate cancer using a process called Congealing. </li>
<li>Learnt web-related languages like xHTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP (Database: MySql). </li>
<li>Was able to use my web development skills to create and manage an online buddy-matching and accommodation platform for students (<a href = "http://www.yourflatmate.co.uk" target="_blank">www.yourflatmate.co.uk</a>). </li>
<li>Developed skills in using Windows and Linux. Such skills include using the UNIX command line interface and also writing scripts like Bash Scripts, sed scripts and awk scripts to search or manipulate data in a file.</li>

<li>A consistent blogger with various positive feedback (<a href = "http://olushares.wordpress.com" target="_blank">olushares.wordpress.com</a>) </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li> <h4>Commitment and enthusiasm for solving complex problems.</h4> 
<ul>
<li>Able to solve problems effectively through logic and use of Mathematics (gained 95% in my first year module). </li>
<li>I was also able to apply this skill in creating <a href = "http://www.yourflatmate.co.uk" target="_blank">www.yourflatmate.co.uk</a> partially using a bespoke CMS software that had to be structured to fit for purpose and then hosting the website on a self-managed VPS Linux server without having prior knowledge of carrying this task out.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li> <h4>Teamwork and Organising</h4> Have a good understanding of the value of teamwork. Have been involved in a team of 3 in a Vision Graphics Visualisation research project, a team of 2 people working in a mental care home and a team of up to 12 people in a catering setting. Also regularly involved in university group projects with friends, and I play football with a departmental team I started and captain hence my organisational skills.</li>
