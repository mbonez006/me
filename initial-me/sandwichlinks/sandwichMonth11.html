                            <dd> Having organised the meetup session, it finally took place this week and It was a big success, there was about 20 students and graduates altogether, and it was a good opportunity for students to ask the graduates questions about their life before their graduate scheme (i.e, Uni, previous placements, final year projects, etc), and their life since starting the graduate scheme at STFC (i.e, the work enviroment, what the graduate scheme is like in general, what you get to be involved in, etc etc..). It ended up being a very interactive session.. and I got good feedback from some of the students and graduates involved afterwards..</dd>
                        <dt>Powershell Scripts for Administrating Sharepoint 2013</dt>
                            <dd>This week, I spent time working on writing Powershell scripts for the creation of certain components  for the new "Science Interaction sites" project that the team is currently embarking on. The scripts create elements like content type, columns, etc on a Sharepoint site. This is all done for the sake of being able to automate the task, and also because there is actually a fair few amount of things that needs to be created (and scripting seems to be the best option to do things quickly) </dd>

                            The talk at the meeting was given by a Lady from the Scientific Computing Department at STFC, and her talk was mainly on Keeping Data (like software) and applying metadata to the data so that years down the line they can still be recognisation and understood (even if its no longer relevant and useful)... </dd>

                    <dd>I have been able to learn using Powershell functions, modularising functions (to reduce code duplications, i.e, scripts could be imported into other scripts dynamically), using data sturctures like Powershell's hashtable,etc </dd>
