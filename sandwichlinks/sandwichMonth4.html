             <h4><a href="#" id="week1">Adding Functionality to Web Application ++ Synchrotron Tour</a></h4>
             
             <p>This week, I was mainly working on adding a functionality to my team's latest Software (The Scheduler) - I was specifically adding a "ManageTeams" page that will be used to manage the teams that will be using the Scheduler application.
                 <br> In implementing this, I wrote back-end (Java) code that includes web methods (SOAP) - this created the opportunity for me to learn more about web methods and gatekeepers. I also had to interact with the database from the Java code, so I was able to learn more in regards to JPA (Java Persistence API) - Using Entity Manager, persisting data, etc. 
                 <br> I also wrote front-end code in order to display results and handle the "team management" of the application. I used ASP.NET and Telerik tags - which provided me with the opportunity to learn more about interacting with telerik tags such as "RadListBox", and ASP.NET tags such as "DropDownList".
                 <br>To start this, I initially had to draw a mockup of what the page will look like. And was able to complete this task at the end of the week. <br><br>
                 <strong>Synchrotron Tour</strong><br>
                 This week, I had a 1 hour Synchrotron Tour for one of ISIS' target station... Check the images below</p>

                <strong>Computing Group Meeting</strong><br>
                 I attended the monthly computing group meeting this week. It was insightful especially after he guy that gave a talk shed more light on what the "RAL Space" department of STFC actually does and how they use software in their day to day activities.<br><br>

                 <p>I was able to learn about Integration Test this week. I wrote a few Integration tests for the web server methods I had written previously while adding the "Teams management" functionality
                     <br><br><strong>Sharepoint 2013</strong><br>
                     I was able to take a significant amount of time setting up and installing Sharepoint 2013 on a virtual machine. This involved installing all the prerequisites such as an OS (windows 8), SQL Server 2012, etc.
                     This took some time but was pleased at the end. It's kinda interesting working on a virtual environment

                 <p>I was able to release my team's main application to production for the first time. This required extra checking of things (e.g Database scripts that runs running, etc) and also required extra caution.
                 <br>I carried out the deployment of the application using Jenkins (our continuous Integration System).
                 
                     <br><br><strong>Custom Page layout On Sharepoint 2013</strong><br>
                 After installing Sharepoint 2013, my task was then to read tutorials and basically have a good go at how customising a site, web-pages, master pages, layout pages, and making them all fit into each other - hence designing them appropriately on Sharepoint 2013 - that was initially not easy for me to get my head around, but then it became clear and fun!
                 <br><br><strong>Supporter Of The Week (SOTW)</strong><br>
                     It was my turn to support the users of our application. Not a very busy week, but it still involved me having to show quick problem solving skills in order to resolve one issue or the other. I also had to write a couple of fancy SQL scripts.
