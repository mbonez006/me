             <h3>Week 1</h3>
             <h4><a href="#" id="week1"> Setting Things Up</a></h4>
             <p>
                 Well, my first week at STFC was quite interesting. I met loads of people and could hardly retain any of the names.
                 I met the helpful team I'll be working with. <br>
                 I spent my first couple of days setting my workstation up and installing all the software I'll be needing. This includes the typical
                 development software like Netbeans. But I also had to enable Active directory and similar stuff...<br>
                 Also in the first week, I attended trainings after trainings. Attended trainings and meetings on Health and Safety, Occupational Health,
                 HR meetings, computing group meetings, etc<br>
                 I ended the week by starting to go through tutorials to catchup/learn the technologies I'll be using over time. My first tutorials were on
                 front-end related web development stuff - These technologies includes HTML5, JQuery, Bootstrap, ASP.NET and C#.

             <h3>Week 2</h3>
             <h4><a href="#" id="week2">Tutorials and Support</a></h4>    
            <p>
                Spent some more time reading tutorials. Emphasis on ASP.NET, C# and now Java EE.
                Started looking into supporting the users of the software being made from the team.
                This support can either be via phone or email and are generally technical supports.
                This required learning and understanding the different aspects of the system and applications. It also included learning
                how to communicate appropriately when supporting application users that are basically scientists and 'Dr's in their different fields.

<!-- WEEK 3 -->             
             <h3>Week 3</h3>
             <h4><a href="#" id="week3">Testing and Java EE</a></h4>    
            <p>
                I was introduced to the testing part of Software Engineering - This included Unit testing, Integration Testing and UI Testing.<br>
                Since looking at testing, I was introduced to looking at back-end code of some of the applications we use - This was written using Java EE.
                For Unit testing - I was introduced to using JMockIt which I found quite nice to write (when writing a new test), but can get tricky if/when modifying existing code.
                For Integration test - I was introduced to using technologies which includes SVN and GlassFish.
                I'm working on fixing failed unit tests (over 200) - which failed due to some refactoring that I did.<br><br>

                Starting to roughly know what I'm doing - which is great!
