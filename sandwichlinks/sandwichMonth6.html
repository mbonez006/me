                 I finally got to meet the Head of ISIS Department.. Here I got to know him and the department better and he got to know a bit more about me. <br><br>     
                     <strong>XmlNode</strong><br>
                     For the remaining part of the week, I worked on fixing bugs on some of the systems my team developed. One in particular isn't yet available for users, but it is expected to be available to users soon - but it had a Maths calculation error. To tackle this task, there was a need to read data from a Sharepoint List on a Sharepoint site for usage on ASP.NET and C# project. I had to build the structure of the data from Sharepoint into XmlNodes class. And then the processed data was saved back into a Sharepoint List. This gave me the opportunity to have a play with OCML Technology.

                <strong>Student Interviews</strong><br>
                Two days this week was dedicated to helping out with the interviews that were going on on-site. Students that are looking to do a placement year at STFC next year were present.
                     <br><br>
                     There was also a Christmas lunch at the end of the week which involved having Christmas lunch with other students on site and also with fellow staff and colleagues..

                <p>
                    The main application myself and my team were working on had finishing touches applied to it in order for it to be ready for full release and usage in the new year. This involved manually having to put certain users into certain roles and team. This required using some setup pages that we had built into the system to make some of these changes and also actually typing SQL scripts that make certain changes on the database.
