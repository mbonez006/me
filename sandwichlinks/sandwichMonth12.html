                        <dt>Staff Recognition Award</dt>
                            <dd>This week, I was <strong>nominated and won</strong> a <strong>Staff Recognition Award!</strong> in my department (STFC ISIS).<br>
                            This came as a surprised and I actually don't know who nominated me, but the award was for the following category;
                            <ul>
                                <li>Those who ‘go the extra mile’</li>
                                <li>Those who make a difference, whether through a specific idea or with their attitude to work and/or influence on others, or good management / performance in the SHE arena</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            The award took the form of a £50 Amazon voucher (Click "Show or Hide Image" link on the side to view a picture).<br>
                            I also received a certificate which the head of department (head of STFC ISIS - Robert McGreevy) presented personally.<br>
                            The award was also announced publicly on the ISIS Internal Information System and also published in in-Brief (Email Newsletter).

                            <dd>The team had a Try It Out Day where I got to try out a technology that I had not used before. I spent the day learning and making small programs with <strong>Ruby</strong>. This was interesting... it was particularly interesting seeing the number of ways you can loop through a collection in Ruby.</dd>
                        <dt>Extended my work Contract for another month</dt>
                            <dd>So there'll be a "July" blog post because I extended my work contract for another month. This is with the hope that I could spent the time to be more involved with the development phase of the SISItes project I had spent time researching and making prototypes and writing scripts for.</dd>

                            <dd>I spent time matching a predesigned-purely-HTML website to be in alignment with a Sharepoint Page Layout. Using Bootstrap, this involved moving Sharepoint site column generated 'div's about, and adding extra tags.

This would include a major public access day where the entire facility would be open and about 10,000 members of the public are expected to visit the facility.<br> The computing students and graduates of my department decided to build robots that can race/fight each other to use as a demo that would be displayed on the Public Access Open Day (on Saturday 11/07/2015) in order to tell the visitors about ISIS Computing Group.<br>(Click "Show or Hide Image" link on the side to view pictures).<br>
                    I worked on/programmed a technology known as "Leap Motion" which is used to control the robots by simply using hand gestures..</dd>

So this was a major project! - At this point I was experimenting with using Sharepoint's Web Part Zones and Web Parts (using Snippets) to see if they could be used by a user that is editing a Sharepoint page to select an image from a library!  </dd>

                    <dd>I was opportune to give a talk to about 30 School kids =on the first day of the Open Week. It was nice telling the kids about myself, what I do at STFC and a bit about my personal story - i.e.e access route to get to where I am currently from what I just finished school.</dd>

                    <dd>I'll be helping out at STFC's Open week, being one of the people that man the Computing Group's robot. <br>
                    Also, my picture was used on the poster for the Graduate Training Scheme and placed at a place where it can be viewed by about 10,000 people that visit STFC that week.
